    Angular.love is one of the biggest and most popular polish blogs about
    Angular. We are expanding and rapidly growing, which can be proved by the
    fact that our blog has over 4000 unique visitors every month (from Poland
    and abroad) and more than 2100 followers on Facebook.
    <br />
    <br />
    Our mission is to inspire, educate, spread good practices and share
    knowledge among Developers. Every 2 months we also organize Angular Meetups
    in Warsaw, during which the speakers present different, angular-related
    topics and share their knowledge among others. Our content is free and
    available for everyone – we want to make the Angular Community grow! Ok, but
    what’s in it for you?
